"""Assemble a show's segments into one deliverable audio file.

A show declares its structure once, in `shows/<slug>/config.json`, as an
ordered list of slots. Each slot is either an `asset` (a fixed file the show
owns -- the standing intro, the outro) or an `episode` file the producer
supplies this time. Any agent handed a folder of pieces can then assemble
them without knowing anything show-specific:

    python3 scripts/stitch_audio.py --show in-focus --from ./raw/ --out ep.mp3

Two invariants, both learned the hard way elsewhere in this repo:

1. Order comes from the config, never from the filesystem. `sorted()` is not
   playback order -- "mid" sorts before "mix", which is why the E10-E18
   manifests all record Wonder Cabinet's parts backwards. See
   `scripts/resolve_audio.py` and CLAUDE.md.
2. Resolution fails loudly and completely. A stitch that silently drops or
   reorders a segment produces a file that sounds fine for its first minute
   and is wrong thereafter -- the kind of error that reaches air. Every
   problem is reported at once, so one run tells you everything.

Everything for an episode lives under its show folder, the stitched
deliverable included: `--episode <slug>` reads the pieces from that episode's
audio directory and writes the result back beside them. `--from` and `--out`
override either half for one-offs.

Usage:
    # The normal case: pieces in the episode folder, output back into it
    python3 scripts/stitch_audio.py --show in-focus --episode 6INF0123

    # Pieces from somewhere else, output still in the episode folder
    python3 scripts/stitch_audio.py --show in-focus --episode 6INF0123 \
        --from ~/Downloads/ingest/

    # Pin a slot the patterns can't resolve (also overrides an asset slot)
    python3 scripts/stitch_audio.py --show in-focus --episode 6INF0123 \
        --slot program=~/Downloads/0815_cut.mp3

    # Report the plan, touching nothing
    python3 scripts/stitch_audio.py --show mccoshen-ross --from ./raw/ --dry-run
